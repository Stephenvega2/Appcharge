Gaslite Token: Powering Strategic Energy**
In the world of **SecureToken**, the Gaslite Token stands as a unique energy resource, driving gameplay and strategy. Here's what makes it so special:

#### **What is the Gaslite Token?**
The Gaslite Token is a one-of-a-kind in-game asset. Represented as a powerful metaphorâ€”a gas pump channeling energy directly into a computerâ€”it symbolizes the burning, buying, and selling of tokens to fuel your journey. Each Gaslite Token is uniquely generated through entropy-based randomness and eigenvalues, making it a secure, strategic, and rare find.

#### **Core Features of the Gaslite Token**:
1. **Fuel for Energy Boosts**: Burn Gaslite Tokens to recharge and extend your energy during critical moments.
2. **Dynamic Value**: The tokenâ€™s rarity and sigma attributes (`sigma_x`, `sigma_y`, `sigma_z`) directly influence its value and strategic importance.
3. **Unlock Advanced Gameplay**: Accumulate enough Gaslite Tokens to unlock powerful features such as enhanced levels, extended hold times, and more.
4. **Hoarding Penalty**: Careful management is keyâ€”unused Gaslite Tokens lead to rising heat and dropping prices, creating a high-stakes balancing act.

#### **Strategize to Thrive**:
Players must make decisions carefully: will you burn tokens for an immediate energy boost, sell them at peak value, or save them to unlock game-changing features? With hoarding penalties in play, the choice isnâ€™t always easy, but the rewards are worth it!
